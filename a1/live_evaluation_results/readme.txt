Please note that you must allow any network devices in the Seneca's OPS535 virtual labs with IP addresses in 172.20.0.0/16 and 192.168.0.0/16 networks to query your primary DNS server and your root name server.

Please review the four query results files in this folder to help you fix the issues you may have on your primary DNS server and/or your root name server.
Issues may be due to firewall settings, Bind's main configuration file (/etc/named.conf) settings, and contents in the zone files.

You are allowed to start working on the fixes as soon as you can and must finish fixing all your issues by 3:20pm on Friday, June 25, 2021.
